       " 'review/text: I just received this item two days ago. Way ahead of schedule, which was a nice surprise. The carpet is not plush commercial grade as stated in the description. It\\'s very thin and basic. A little bit disappointed but pretty much what I expected. Problem is, when you put your hand on the step the carpet goes in to meet the wood underneath. I don\\'t know if the wood is warped or what. It\\'s that way on every step. Scares my 16-lb dog a little bit when he goes up, won\\'t go down at all. He jumps off the bed which I don\\'t like because my bed is very tall, about 3 ft from the floor. I also have a 7-lb dog that has a dislocated knee cap and collapsing trachea. He goes about half way up then sits there. Not too crazy about coming down. The steps are each about 6.5 - 7\" tall and deep. Deeper would be better but then it\\'d stick out into the bedroom too far. Since I haven\\'t had them very long, I\\'m still going to give the steps a chance. If the whole situation improves I\\'ll come back and give it a higher rating. It would have been nice to have a little padding on top of each step under the carpet, wouldn\\'t cost much at all to add it, rather than have the thin carpet directly on top of the wood. The price is pretty good. I researched all over the internet and found this price to be the most reasonable. Three stars for now!',\n",

Comes with a plastic packed pump (not shown) that you just screw in when you take off the lid. My dog likes the taste. We use it for arthritis benefit. Vet suggested his mild neck arthritis would decrease from food high in omega-3s (reduces inflammation) and low in omega-6s (improves infection resistance but increases inflammation). The problem is, commercial dog food makers have decided infection from poor dental health is more dangerous to senior dogs than arthritis, and make senior formulas with omega-6s far outweighing omega-3s. The vet's food was not only very poor nutritional quality (no meat, only by-products!) it was ghastly expensive. Adding Kronch oil to a quality commercial food was the answer. For each pump, my dog receives 1050 mg of omeg-3s and only 150 mg of omega-6. This is way better omega-3 to omega-6 ratios than even the vet food!\",\n",

There is a lot of padding so I was never able to feel his bite. Depending on how your dog plays you will need to hold onto the inside of the puppet to keep him from tearing it off your hand. The toy is pretty tough and is easily able to support his full weight (30 lbs) dangling from his jaw. The last one I received as a gift and made the mistake of giving it too him after a play session and he destroyed it. So hopefully this one will last a long time.

       " \"review/text: I had an infestation of mites in my hamster cage. I lost two litters of babies. I was at a lost as to what to do. Aside from the fact that mites can get out and bite humans. They can not reproduce on humans...at least not rodent mites but they can still make you itch. I was telling a friend of mine and she called her sister who is a vet. She told me (the vet)that the price to pay to treat a hamster was almost $60.00 per hamster. I have 3 dwarf hamsters. She gave me a tip that she learned while in med school.Mix one half pine, one half cedar at least two inches deep for the animals to borrow. Remove all toys and wash in dishwasher or in hot soapy water...wood also. Leave them out of the cage so the hamsters will borrow, this is very important, it gets the oils on their skin. Fleas, ticks, and MITES can not stand cedar-( that is why most animal beds...cat, doges are filled with cedar). Leave it in the cage for one week (WITHOUT TOYS). Change out and repeat. You can not add toys once again. Repeat for 4 weeks.You know what? IT WORKED. Now here is the kick ass part. I bought Carefresh and guess what it was filed with mites when I had my vet take a sample from the bag. I will stick with Pine and cedar. Little less on the cedar with the pine but just to be safe. Cedar has a bad rep. Hamsters are short term pets...they only live about 2 years tops...most times they die is because they have something else wrong with them. Very rarely will a hamster die from inhaling cedar fumes. If you have them in a cage the fumes will be released, in a tank they will be released. Use your own judgement. But I have had two healthy litter of pups, the hamsters no longer have open wounds from where they were scratching. I am not itching anymore and my place smells like the forest...it smells like Christmas all year long. BTW Cedar keeps Mosquitoes out of the house. So I'll let you make thew choice. But I wanted to share in case you have a mite problem. I will not buy Carefresh again the is for sure.\",\n",

A flea cycle is 21 days-using this product in a combination with proper flea control is the best way to get the maximum performance. Spray where pet sleeps, all carpets, furniture, area rugs, and fabrics where fleas can lay eggs. Keep it up once a week or more for the first 3 weeks to break the flea cycle while applying flea medication to your pets. Humans can carry fleas into the house as well as pets. The trick is to stay on top of the flea cycle so it doesn't become out of hand.

You could hold the can upside down and didn't have to as much bending. The 16 oz. can is suitable for most small homes. I have only 1000 square feet. The larger can comes in handy for additional applications. We have only one cat and she does not go outside. It's the humans bringing the fleas indoors either from other people's pets or from the fleas that are naturally living outside. Don't forget to treat your cat as well. Fleas can cause animals serious illnesses.

       " \"review/text: We WERE using a flea prevention on our diabetic cat when we took her to upstate NY. Unfortunately, we did not know that fleas in that part of the country (NC, too) are Immune to Frontline...so she came home with fleas. We do Rescue. We had 20 cats and two dogs and were INFESTED. We could not bomb the house because we had three very large fish tanks...I tried this and treated all the animals with Frontline. We STILL had fleas and it was getting WORSE...THEN I found out from friends in various parts of the US that Frontline doesn't work in some areas of the country--obviously NOT upstate NY. SO, we Resprayed EVERYWHERE and treated the animals with Advantage and Revolution...THAT did the trick.

It's even a little eerie in its stark silence, with jagged holes in the hull hinting at some terrible ocean tragedy long ago. Of course, the holes also provide ample room for fish to swim, and the hollow interior is a great place for them to hide.Decorating an aquarium is mostly about individual taste, so this won't mean much to people who're going with another theme.

       " \"review/text: I've tried virtually every kind of equipment for controlling dogs (from standard collars to choke chains to prong collars), and the Halti has become my favorite piece of gear for walking my dog. Being able to control my dog is particularly important given that he's a great dane who weighs in at 130 lbs.Anyone who has worked with horses will be easily familiar with the Halti (it's basically a bridle) and that's what makes it effective for controlling animals: it gives you complete control over their head (which will control what the rest of their body does).What I like about the Halti is that it affords me the same (or better) level of control over my dog with less danger of injury or discomfort for the dog. While walking, my dog and I have been attacked by other dogs on several occasions and I'm able to completely subdue my dog with one hand - leaving the other hand free to deal with the interloper.The only thing I don't like about it is that the small clip meant to attach to the dog's regular collar is somewhat flimsy and I've already gone through one Halti where the pin bent from normal use.\",\n",

       " \"review/text: I have tried 3 different styles of head harnesses on my Cane Corso Pup.. hes 8months now and 90 lbs of pure muscle that loves to pull. I don't much care for choke chains since he just pulls, chokes and gags over and over.As for the prev reviewer, most dogs need to be conditioned to new experiences like a head collar, or clipping toe nails..My pup struggled like it was the end of the world the first few times we tried to put the harness on him (and tried to cut his nails). It's a matter of making them comfortable with the experience.Now he sits at the front door and when I grab the head harness he jams his face into it enthusiastically.Anyway, I have tried the walmart brand harness, don't like it compared to the other 2, it works better than just a collar though.It fits like a gentle leader but the leash clips behind the head, so you don't get as much control over the nose.The gentle leader By premiere worked very well and I had no complaints, however my pup got ahold of it and chewed it up.The halti goes one step further than the gentle leader, it clips under the nose the same way, however the Halti has a floating ring that acts similar to a choker, but on the mouth rather than the neck.. so when the dog pulls, it forces his mouth closed.He doesn't seem to like that very much.. but that's kind of the point of training..I only gave it 4/5 stars because the floating ring for the choker, isn't a true floating ring.It's hard to describe until you see it, but the choker only really works when pulled from one side, from the other side it doesn't close so it works the same as the gentle leader. Guess you are meant to train the dog to walk on your left hand side always. Luckily for me I had already been doing that.. but not so great for you righties.\",\n",

And even if he managed to do so - the material is thicker and stronger. Our dog is a 75 lb lab/bulldog mix, who can out-pull me or my husband on a standard neck collar.

       " 'review/text: I have 2 adult German shepherds. One we\\'ve had since he was 8 weeks and one we rescued last year (approx 2 1/2 years old.) The one we rescued was never leash or collar trained had minimal understanding of commands and not crate trained. He WAS housebroken and after a year, a total love bug and we have no regrets. However, he PULLS constantly on walks.After reading the reviews for this head collar, and having had no success with the Gentle Leader head collar, the Gentle Leader harness, smooth choke or prong choke, I had hoped this would be the answer to our prayers.What I like about this collar is it\\'s design. I feel that it is more secure with that extra clip to the dogs regular collar. Even if the dog manages to slip the head collar, he is still connected to the leash and can\\'t take off. I like the way it fits to the head & face (Size 3 for two 75lb GSD\\'s was perfect)and I like the soft felt pad that rests on the nose. This prevents rubbing and bald spots. The dog may not care for a head collar, but there isn\\'t anything about this that I find to be cruel or unfair to the dog. It\\'s fully adjustable so if it\\'s too tight and hurting the dog--you\\'re not using it properly.My older GSD, 4+ years old, walks beautifully with this collar. No pulling, heels right next to my leg and he is only mildly annoyed with the head collar.He\\'ll periodically rub my leg in an attempt to remove it, but I just redirect him to the walk and he\\'s fine. This may be because for about 8 weeks when he was 7 months old, we used a Gentle Leader on him because he was so hard to walk. This head collar is far superior at getting him to walk properly with me than a prong or smooth choke.My rescued GSD? Not so much. He\\'s a puller and he is a DETERMINED puller. I swear that he just braces his neck and shoulders and he GOES. Nothing we\\'ve used has curtailed this pulling. He is stubborn and he\\'s strong. So for him, this collar did absolutely no good. Which is why I can only give it 3 stars, because while it is fantastic on my older GSD, is it pretty much useless on my younger dog.For the younger dog, we ended up having to seek professional assistance in walking him and he is back on his old collar and we are using techniques we were taught to improve the walking experience. It\\'s a daily struggle with him because he is determined to have his way each time we walk and each day he needs to \"re-learn\" walking but once he accepts that this is the way it is, he does wonderful.I don\\'t discount the success others have had with this collar on \"problem pullers.\" However, I would caution someone that each dog has a unique temperment and what works for one (like my older GSD) will not necessarily work for another.',\n",

I can't take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast 3-6 times.

I have to admit to being one of those owners who rarely leash their dogs, and therefore the dog does not know how to behave on leash. In my defense - I live in a small rural community, my dogs listen well and leave people alone, our yard is fenced, and they wear boundary collars. When away from home, we are usually in the woods, or at the river where they are off-leash anyhow - so leashes are not often necessary. Our town even allows dogs in the theatre and bar, off-leash! This dog is so nuts... she competes in dock dog competitions - pure raw energy, but no leash manners. That being said, I think you can imagine what it was like to walk her on leash across the highway to get to the woods.On a regular leash and collar, her front paws never hit the ground, and her entire abdomen would surge with the force of her pull... I was the only woman capable of handling her, she was so strong. Choke collar - same thing, but add gasping for air. Never tried a prong collar on her. I tried the training thing, but I am just not very consistent, and it would take me hours to cross the street. So, I thought, why not try one of those Holt collars....Now, she hates the thing, and if we stop walking, she is rubbing it on everything trying to get it off, but while walking, she has completely stopped pulling! I'm not exaggerating, the crazy dog no longer pulls! Every time she tried, it would tighten up on her muzzle and turn her head to me. It doesn't hurt her either!I just ordered one for my boxer. She is nowhere as bad, but I could use a leash without tension with her too. I'm a little nervous about the shape of her muzzle, so I will update this once it arrives and I have a chance to try it on her too.\",\n",

       " \"review/text: Overall this does what it's intended to do. My puppy (roughly a 50lb lab mix) got a hold of his last one,a gentle leader head collar (while not wearing it) and managed to chew the plastic clasp so we needed a new one and we bought this. It does a very good job of stopping the pulling and I think this one actually fits better than the Gentle Leader brand because of the way the straps are designed.The reason I gave it four stars instead of five, is that you hook the leash to the head halter below the dog's jaw. This means your leash hangs down in front of the dog, and in my case it seem's he is always tripping on the leash or stepping over it so it ends up under his stomach/between his legs. This was the case with both head collars we've had. I can kind of avoid it if I hold the leash up high enough in a certain way,but it's still annoying. I might just get a normal harness that goes around his body and fastens to the leash by his back,but then again the head collar is quick and easy to put on.\",\n",

If you let the dog squirm around and paw at it and get it in their mouth, sure they will chew it up. Offering treats instead and taking their attention off the halter will stop that behavior. Unfortunately the uninformed dog owner will give a poor review. When used properly this is the best product I have ever used.

       " \"review/text: I've used the Gentle Leader head harness for a number of my dogs, including some rescues that I was fostering. They worked but I found several problems with them. The nose piece isn't padded so it tended to rub on the dogs nose and also frequently rode up to the edge of their eyes, no matter how I adjusted it. I also found you had to make the straps pretty tight, which the dogs didn't like, to help keep it in place. And that sometimes didn't even work as I frequently found the collar had slipped/moved during the walk. Lastly, the straps got looser and looser over time and retightening them would only last a short while before they needed readjusting.I decided to try this product, the Holt head harness, the successor to the very popular Halti. Received it and was very impressed with the design as well as the padding on the nose strap (to prevent rubbing) and the additional strap for connecting to the dog's regular collar. Used them last night for the first time, one on my 87 lb German Shepherd (size 3) and one on my 42 lb 2 year old mix (very much still a puppy) (size 2). The Holt collars fit perfectly and were very easy to adjust. My German Shepherd didn't mind it at all, the puppy resisted a little at first (as she always did w/ the gentle leader) but quickly settled in. Took a nice long walk and came home. Both were still adjusted perfectly, no slippage or movement, and no irritation on their noses. They also seemed to give a little more control, easier head turning, than the gentle leader.I'm glad I made the change. Very highly recommended.\",\n",

I do recommend a trial fit or two before going out with it.Not so good: If you have a dog who digs their heels in, and pulls in the opposite direction, you may have an issue with them pulling this over their head. After it happened twice, I would just walk toward my dog when he did this and it didn't become habitual. My dog would also drop to the ground to try to rub it off his face, so it didn't speed up our walks for awhile. I dropped one star for these two issues as it's definitely a design issue, and some other dogs I tried it on did the same thing, so I'm sure it's fairly common.Overall, however, the difference was immediate! Our dog would pull like crazy before and, after wearing this, every time he tried to pull his head would be redirected to whoever was walking him. No need to tug, as the dog is the one who either pulls their head around or doesn't. When he stops pulling, he can look where he wants. If he tries to walk in the opposite direction, he's gently redirected. He still drops and rubs from time to time - or rubs up against our legs - but after using it consistently for awhile, and erratically for some time now, he is well behaved on his leash and doesn't drag me, my wife or the kids around anymore.\",\n",

It only tightens a bit if he pulls on the leash.Can't say enough good things about these trainers. We'll be buying more of them.\",\n",

       " \"review/text: Tycho is twice the size of a normal Shiba, currently 38 pounds and purebred. He's a rescue, re-homed due to his anxiety issues getting him into trouble. This head halter gives us confidence that we can keep him under control no matter how scared he gets or how many delicious cats he sees. Tycho does know how to throw off the head halter when he's upset, but that doesn't matter. The halter is securely connected to his collar, and by the time he's tossed one, we've caught him by the other and he's safely under control.If you have concerns about pulling during walks or your dog slipping his collar, this is a great solution. It may take a couple tries to get the right size, but the effort is well worth it.\",\n",

It\\'s very thin and basic. A little bit disappointed but pretty much what I expected. Problem is, when you put your hand on the step the carpet goes in to meet the wood underneath. I don\\'t know if the wood is warped or what. It\\'s that way on every step. Scares my 16-lb dog a little bit when he goes up, won\\'t go down at all. He jumps off the bed which I don\\'t like because my bed is very tall, about 3 ft from the floor. I also have a 7-lb dog that has a dislocated knee cap and collapsing trachea. He goes about half way up then sits there. Not too crazy about coming down. The steps are each about 6.5 - 7\" tall and deep. Deeper would be better but then it\\'d stick out into the bedroom too far. Since I haven\\'t had them very long, I\\'m still going to give the steps a chance. If the whole situation improves I\\'ll come back and give it a higher rating. It would have been nice to have a little padding on top of each step under the carpet, wouldn\\'t cost much at all to add it, rather than have the thin carpet directly on top of the wood. The price is pretty good. I researched all over the internet and found this price to be the most reasonable. Three stars for now!',\n",

Comes with a plastic packed pump (not shown) that you just screw in when you take off the lid. My dog likes the taste. We use it for arthritis benefit. Vet suggested his mild neck arthritis would decrease from food high in omega-3s (reduces inflammation) and low in omega-6s (improves infection resistance but increases inflammation). The problem is, commercial dog food makers have decided infection from poor dental health is more dangerous to senior dogs than arthritis, and make senior formulas with omega-6s far outweighing omega-3s. The vet's food was not only very poor nutritional quality (no meat, only by-products!) it was ghastly expensive. Adding Kronch oil to a quality commercial food was the answer. For each pump, my dog receives 1050 mg of omeg-3s and only 150 mg of omega-6. This is way better omega-3 to omega-6 ratios than even the vet food!\",\n",

There is a lot of padding so I was never able to feel his bite. Depending on how your dog plays you will need to hold onto the inside of the puppet to keep him from tearing it off your hand. The toy is pretty tough and is easily able to support his full weight (30 lbs) dangling from his jaw. The last one I received as a gift and made the mistake of giving it too him after a play session and he destroyed it. So hopefully this one will last a long time.

They can not reproduce on humans...at least not rodent mites but they can still make you itch. I was telling a friend of mine and she called her sister who is a vet. She told me (the vet)that the price to pay to treat a hamster was almost $60.00 per hamster. I have 3 dwarf hamsters. She gave me a tip that she learned while in med school.Mix one half pine, one half cedar at least two inches deep for the animals to borrow. Remove all toys and wash in dishwasher or in hot soapy water...wood also. Leave them out of the cage so the hamsters will borrow, this is very important, it gets the oils on their skin. Fleas, ticks, and MITES can not stand cedar-( that is why most animal beds...cat, doges are filled with cedar). Leave it in the cage for one week (WITHOUT TOYS). Change out and repeat. You can not add toys once again. Repeat for 4 weeks.You know what? IT WORKED. Now here is the kick ass part. I bought Carefresh and guess what it was filed with mites when I had my vet take a sample from the bag. I will stick with Pine and cedar. Little less on the cedar with the pine but just to be safe. Cedar has a bad rep. Hamsters are short term pets...they only live about 2 years tops...most times they die is because they have something else wrong with them. Very rarely will a hamster die from inhaling cedar fumes. If you have them in a cage the fumes will be released, in a tank they will be released. Use your own judgement. But I have had two healthy litter of pups, the hamsters no longer have open wounds from where they were scratching. I am not itching anymore and my place smells like the forest...it smells like Christmas all year long. BTW Cedar keeps Mosquitoes out of the house. So I'll let you make thew choice. But I wanted to share in case you have a mite problem. I will not buy Carefresh again the is for sure.\",\n",

A flea cycle is 21 days-using this product in a combination with proper flea control is the best way to get the maximum performance. Spray where pet sleeps, all carpets, furniture, area rugs, and fabrics where fleas can lay eggs. Keep it up once a week or more for the first 3 weeks to break the flea cycle while applying flea medication to your pets. Humans can carry fleas into the house as well as pets. The trick is to stay on top of the flea cycle so it doesn't become out of hand.

The larger can comes in handy for additional applications. We have only one cat and she does not go outside. It's the humans bringing the fleas indoors either from other people's pets or from the fleas that are naturally living outside. Don't forget to treat your cat as well.

I returned after a few hours, opened the widows and started up the air conditioners and picked up the dog. The next day I noticed several adult fleas, though they were sluggish. I thought..great! Then the family started getting bites and seeing small and adult fleas. I feel I wasted my money for a product that seemed to give us 24hrs of relief.

It's even a little eerie in its stark silence, with jagged holes in the hull hinting at some terrible ocean tragedy long ago. Of course, the holes also provide ample room for fish to swim, and the hollow interior is a great place for them to hide.Decorating an aquarium is mostly about individual taste, so this won't mean much to people who're going with another theme. Still, shipwreck buffs will find this a good piece to bring home to your favorite piscine environment.\",\n",

       " \"review/text: I've tried virtually every kind of equipment for controlling dogs (from standard collars to choke chains to prong collars), and the Halti has become my favorite piece of gear for walking my dog. Being able to control my dog is particularly important given that he's a great dane who weighs in at 130 lbs.Anyone who has worked with horses will be easily familiar with the Halti (it's basically a bridle) and that's what makes it effective for controlling animals: it gives you complete control over their head (which will control what the rest of their body does).What I like about the Halti is that it affords me the same (or better) level of control over my dog with less danger of injury or discomfort for the dog. While walking, my dog and I have been attacked by other dogs on several occasions and I'm able to completely subdue my dog with one hand - leaving the other hand free to deal with the interloper.The only thing I don't like about it is that the small clip meant to attach to the dog's regular collar is somewhat flimsy and I've already gone through one Halti where the pin bent from normal use.\",\n",

       " \"review/text: I have tried 3 different styles of head harnesses on my Cane Corso Pup.. hes 8months now and 90 lbs of pure muscle that loves to pull. I don't much care for choke chains since he just pulls, chokes and gags over and over.As for the prev reviewer, most dogs need to be conditioned to new experiences like a head collar, or clipping toe nails..My pup struggled like it was the end of the world the first few times we tried to put the harness on him (and tried to cut his nails). It's a matter of making them comfortable with the experience.Now he sits at the front door and when I grab the head harness he jams his face into it enthusiastically.Anyway, I have tried the walmart brand harness, don't like it compared to the other 2, it works better than just a collar though.It fits like a gentle leader but the leash clips behind the head, so you don't get as much control over the nose.The gentle leader By premiere worked very well and I had no complaints, however my pup got ahold of it and chewed it up.The halti goes one step further than the gentle leader, it clips under the nose the same way, however the Halti has a floating ring that acts similar to a choker, but on the mouth rather than the neck.. so when the dog pulls, it forces his mouth closed.He doesn't seem to like that very much.. but that's kind of the point of training..I only gave it 4/5 stars because the floating ring for the choker, isn't a true floating ring.It's hard to describe until you see it, but the choker only really works when pulled from one side, from the other side it doesn't close so it works the same as the gentle leader. Guess you are meant to train the dog to walk on your left hand side always. Luckily for me I had already been doing that.. but not so great for you righties.\",\n",

And even if he managed to do so - the material is thicker and stronger. Our dog is a 75 lb lab/bulldog mix, who can out-pull me or my husband on a standard neck collar.

       " 'review/text: I have 2 adult German shepherds. One we\\'ve had since he was 8 weeks and one we rescued last year (approx 2 1/2 years old.) The one we rescued was never leash or collar trained had minimal understanding of commands and not crate trained. He WAS housebroken and after a year, a total love bug and we have no regrets. However, he PULLS constantly on walks.After reading the reviews for this head collar, and having had no success with the Gentle Leader head collar, the Gentle Leader harness, smooth choke or prong choke, I had hoped this would be the answer to our prayers.What I like about this collar is it\\'s design. I feel that it is more secure with that extra clip to the dogs regular collar. Even if the dog manages to slip the head collar, he is still connected to the leash and can\\'t take off. I like the way it fits to the head & face (Size 3 for two 75lb GSD\\'s was perfect)and I like the soft felt pad that rests on the nose. This prevents rubbing and bald spots. The dog may not care for a head collar, but there isn\\'t anything about this that I find to be cruel or unfair to the dog. It\\'s fully adjustable so if it\\'s too tight and hurting the dog--you\\'re not using it properly.My older GSD, 4+ years old, walks beautifully with this collar. No pulling, heels right next to my leg and he is only mildly annoyed with the head collar.He\\'ll periodically rub my leg in an attempt to remove it, but I just redirect him to the walk and he\\'s fine. This may be because for about 8 weeks when he was 7 months old, we used a Gentle Leader on him because he was so hard to walk. This head collar is far superior at getting him to walk properly with me than a prong or smooth choke.My rescued GSD? Not so much. He\\'s a puller and he is a DETERMINED puller. I swear that he just braces his neck and shoulders and he GOES. Nothing we\\'ve used has curtailed this pulling. He is stubborn and he\\'s strong. So for him, this collar did absolutely no good. Which is why I can only give it 3 stars, because while it is fantastic on my older GSD, is it pretty much useless on my younger dog.For the younger dog, we ended up having to seek professional assistance in walking him and he is back on his old collar and we are using techniques we were taught to improve the walking experience. It\\'s a daily struggle with him because he is determined to have his way each time we walk and each day he needs to \"re-learn\" walking but once he accepts that this is the way it is, he does wonderful.I don\\'t discount the success others have had with this collar on \"problem pullers.\" However, I would caution someone that each dog has a unique temperment and what works for one (like my older GSD) will not necessarily work for another.',\n",

I can't take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast 3-6 times.

       " \"review/text: I have a black lab / blue heeler mix that is totally nuts. She looooves running, and fetching. I have to admit to being one of those owners who rarely leash their dogs, and therefore the dog does not know how to behave on leash. In my defense - I live in a small rural community, my dogs listen well and leave people alone, our yard is fenced, and they wear boundary collars. When away from home, we are usually in the woods, or at the river where they are off-leash anyhow - so leashes are not often necessary. Our town even allows dogs in the theatre and bar, off-leash! This dog is so nuts... she competes in dock dog competitions - pure raw energy, but no leash manners. That being said, I think you can imagine what it was like to walk her on leash across the highway to get to the woods.On a regular leash and collar, her front paws never hit the ground, and her entire abdomen would surge with the force of her pull... I was the only woman capable of handling her, she was so strong. Choke collar - same thing, but add gasping for air. Never tried a prong collar on her. I tried the training thing, but I am just not very consistent, and it would take me hours to cross the street. So, I thought, why not try one of those Holt collars....Now, she hates the thing, and if we stop walking, she is rubbing it on everything trying to get it off, but while walking, she has completely stopped pulling! I'm not exaggerating, the crazy dog no longer pulls! Every time she tried, it would tighten up on her muzzle and turn her head to me. It doesn't hurt her either!I just ordered one for my boxer. She is nowhere as bad, but I could use a leash without tension with her too. I'm a little nervous about the shape of her muzzle, so I will update this once it arrives and I have a chance to try it on her too.\",\n",

       " \"review/text: Overall this does what it's intended to do. My puppy (roughly a 50lb lab mix) got a hold of his last one,a gentle leader head collar (while not wearing it) and managed to chew the plastic clasp so we needed a new one and we bought this. It does a very good job of stopping the pulling and I think this one actually fits better than the Gentle Leader brand because of the way the straps are designed.The reason I gave it four stars instead of five, is that you hook the leash to the head halter below the dog's jaw. This means your leash hangs down in front of the dog, and in my case it seem's he is always tripping on the leash or stepping over it so it ends up under his stomach/between his legs. This was the case with both head collars we've had. I can kind of avoid it if I hold the leash up high enough in a certain way,but it's still annoying. I might just get a normal harness that goes around his body and fastens to the leash by his back,but then again the head collar is quick and easy to put on.\",\n",

After working with the dog for 15 minutes giving treats and making sure I am not pulling in any manner, 100% of the dogs are now walking calmly next to me with me using a pinky to hold the leash. If you let the dog squirm around and paw at it and get it in their mouth, sure they will chew it up. Offering treats instead and taking their attention off the halter will stop that behavior. Unfortunately the uninformed dog owner will give a poor review. When used properly this is the best product I have ever used.

       " \"review/text: I've used the Gentle Leader head harness for a number of my dogs, including some rescues that I was fostering. They worked but I found several problems with them. The nose piece isn't padded so it tended to rub on the dogs nose and also frequently rode up to the edge of their eyes, no matter how I adjusted it. I also found you had to make the straps pretty tight, which the dogs didn't like, to help keep it in place. And that sometimes didn't even work as I frequently found the collar had slipped/moved during the walk. Lastly, the straps got looser and looser over time and retightening them would only last a short while before they needed readjusting.I decided to try this product, the Holt head harness, the successor to the very popular Halti. Received it and was very impressed with the design as well as the padding on the nose strap (to prevent rubbing) and the additional strap for connecting to the dog's regular collar. Used them last night for the first time, one on my 87 lb German Shepherd (size 3) and one on my 42 lb 2 year old mix (very much still a puppy) (size 2). The Holt collars fit perfectly and were very easy to adjust. My German Shepherd didn't mind it at all, the puppy resisted a little at first (as she always did w/ the gentle leader) but quickly settled in. Took a nice long walk and came home. Both were still adjusted perfectly, no slippage or movement, and no irritation on their noses. They also seemed to give a little more control, easier head turning, than the gentle leader.I'm glad I made the change. Very highly recommended.\",\n",

I do recommend a trial fit or two before going out with it.Not so good: If you have a dog who digs their heels in, and pulls in the opposite direction, you may have an issue with them pulling this over their head. After it happened twice, I would just walk toward my dog when he did this and it didn't become habitual. My dog would also drop to the ground to try to rub it off his face, so it didn't speed up our walks for awhile. I dropped one star for these two issues as it's definitely a design issue, and some other dogs I tried it on did the same thing, so I'm sure it's fairly common.Overall, however, the difference was immediate! Our dog would pull like crazy before and, after wearing this, every time he tried to pull his head would be redirected to whoever was walking him. No need to tug, as the dog is the one who either pulls their head around or doesn't. When he stops pulling, he can look where he wants. If he tries to walk in the opposite direction, he's gently redirected. He still drops and rubs from time to time - or rubs up against our legs - but after using it consistently for awhile, and erratically for some time now, he is well behaved on his leash and doesn't drag me, my wife or the kids around anymore.\",\n",

       " \"review/text: Tycho is twice the size of a normal Shiba, currently 38 pounds and purebred. He's a rescue, re-homed due to his anxiety issues getting him into trouble. This head halter gives us confidence that we can keep him under control no matter how scared he gets or how many delicious cats he sees. Tycho does know how to throw off the head halter when he's upset, but that doesn't matter. The halter is securely connected to his collar, and by the time he's tossed one, we've caught him by the other and he's safely under control.If you have concerns about pulling during walks or your dog slipping his collar, this is a great solution. It may take a couple tries to get the right size, but the effort is well worth it.\",\n",

Prior to purchasing the Holt, I had been using the Gentle Leader from Premier and truly liked it. Both collars are similarly designed. The only dislike I had with the Gentle Leader was with the nose loop. It didn't have the supportive cushion my dog required leaving her skin very raw.The Holt collar is designed with a cushioned nose-band which adds extra protection.What I did appropriate with the Premier Gentle Leader was the informative DVD they provided that instructed how to properly fit the collar to the dog and how to properly use it.Transitioning between the two leaders was minimal to nothing. I would recommend either one of these products, they are a life saver!!!\",\n",

       " 'review/text: I purchased two Holt Dog collars and the problem could be my dogs. They did not respond favorably at all to the Holt. I tried all suggestions to make wearing it a pleasant experience, but all the Snausages in the world couldn\\'t bribe my two dogs into an agreeable arrangement. They refused to walk, and kept trying to wrestle their heads out of the collar. One of my dogs screamed loudly as she tried to wrestle the collar off. The neighbors thought we were more entertaining than anything on television.I suspect the problem could be that my dogs are Scottish Terriers. They are head-strong and that can come with the breed. I cringe when I think of the $$ I\\'ve spent to get these girls to walk harmoniously together. When we walk out the door, one pulls left, the other pulls right and the fight begins. I purchased the Holt collars after they knocked me over, I hit my head on the concrete and passed out. The dogs didn\\'t care that I had a concussion, they continued to behave badly.My little Scottish \"Ladies\" now wear Thundershirts. They don\\'t know what to make of them but they fight to be first in line to get the shirt on and they are walking well. I\\'m guessing that to them, having something on their snout like the Holt would be as thrilling as a plastic bag on my head. Who knows these things? Several people recommended the Holt to me and have been successful. None had Scotties... Best of luck to you and your doggies.',\n",
