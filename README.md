# Amazon-Pet-Supplies-Recommendation-System

Based on Amazon pet supplies reviews data, the KNN algorithm is implemented to create the collaborative filtering recommendation. Such a recommendation system could estimate pet stuff ratings for users and recommend the two most similar products a user would love to have, with the highest estimated ratings.

In addition to that, I tried to create a simple sentiment analysis by using the users' experiences and ratings for predicting their helpfulness.
